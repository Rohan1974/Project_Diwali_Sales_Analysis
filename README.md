# Project_Diwali_Sales_Analysis

# Overview

In order to process and visualize data in this project, I used several important libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleansing were the main priorities. 



# Objectives

1. Data cleaning: Comprehensive data cleaning procedures were used to guarantee the accuracy and dependability of the dataset.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To extract insights from the dataset, a thorough EDA was carried out. To find patterns, correlations, and trends, several statistical and visual techniques were used.

3. Sales patterns Analysis: A thorough analysis of sales patterns served as the study's main focus. As a result, we were able to determine the general trend of sales over time.

4. Top-Selling Items: To identify the top-selling items in the dataset, a thorough analysis was done. In order to find products with consistently high sales figures, sales data had to be analyzed.


# Analysis And Visualization Libraries Used

- NumPy: Used for effective array operations and numerical computations.
- Pandas: Used to transform, analyze, and manipulate data.
- Matplotlib: Used in Python to produce animated, interactive, and static visualizations.
- Seaborn: Applied to improve the accuracy and appeal of data visualizations.


# Project Format

The project can be divided into the following sections:

1. Data Filtering: This part goes over the thorough data cleaning procedure that makes sure the dataset is trustworthy for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this method, numerous statistical measures and visualisations are used to uncover the dataset's secrets.

4. Best-Selling Goods Analysis: In this section, I find and examine the merchandise that consistently generates the greatest sales figures.
